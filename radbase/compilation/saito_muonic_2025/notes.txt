Measured muonic transition energies for 1s - 4f7/2 levels with >0.1 keV uncertainty for Pd104, 105, 106, 108, 110 and
fit 2pF distribution for all even isotopes using the 1s-2p and 2p-3d transition energies. Radii do not include any
theoretical uncertainties, and the confidence bands are assymetric. The lower bands are often much stricter than the
upper bands. Barrett radii are also provided, with uncertainty from theory only.
