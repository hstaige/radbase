0.1.0

Combine an input file of independent radii measurements into a recommended radii for each included isotope following a least squares procedure

New Features:

- Identifies groups of nuclides connected by relative measurements
- Optimizes radii from these groups using a least squares minimizer
- Keeps track of measurements that affect optimized radii values, as well as correlations between radii
